        <header>
                Practically, the header can be used for the "masthead" area of a site's header but 
                also as an introduction to other content, such as an introduction section within an 
                article element. You can use it as many times on the same page as needed. You 
                could have a header inside every section on your page
        </header>

        <nav>   
                The nav element is used to wrap major navigational links to other pages or parts 
                within the same page. As it is for use in major navigational blocks it isn't strictly 
                intended for use in footers (although it can be) and the like, where groups of links 
                to other pages are common. If you usually mark up your navigational elements with 
                an unordered list 'ul' and a bunch of list tags (li), you may be better served 
                with a nav and a number of nested 'a' tags instead.
        </nav>

        
        <main>
            The main context area includes content is unique to that documnet and excludes the content that is repeated
            across a set of documents like site navigation bar,site logo,copyright information,banner and search forms(unless
            the documnet main function is that of a search form.<br/>

            There should not be more than one main in the document.
        </main>

        <section>
                <h1>Understanding section</h1>
                The section element is used to define a generic section of a document or 
                application. For example, you may choose to create sections around your content: 
                one section for contact information, another section for news feeds, and so on. It's 
                important to understand that it isn't intended for styling purposes


        </section>


        <article>
            <h1>Understanding Article</h1>
            Unique chuck of information that makes also sense,if you remove from the document and paste somewhere else.<br/>

            Use articles,instead of section when it makes to syndicate the content.<br/>

            Divides the article into section if you want.<br/>

        </article>


        <aside>
            Use it for sidebars, or content as a little tip 
            about a related subject in a blog post. It's also considered suitable for pull quotes, 
            advertising, and groups of navigation elements; basically, anything not directly 
            related to the main content would work well in an aside. If it was an e-commerce 
            site, I'd consider areas like "Customers who bought this also bought" as prime 
            candidates.
        </aside>

        <footer>
                 Like the header, the footer element doesn't take part in the outline algorithm 
                (more on that in the following section) so doesn't section content. Instead it should 
                be used to contain information about the section it sits within. It might contain links 
                to other documents or copyright information, for example. Like the header, it can 
                be used multiple times within a page if needed. For example, it could be used for the 
                footer of a blog but also a footer within a blog post article


        </footer>


        <section>
            <h1>h1â€“h6 elements must not be used to mark up subheadings, subtitles, alternative 
                titles and taglines unless intended to be the heading for a new section or 
                subsection."</h1>
        </section>


        <article>
            <h2>There are some grouping elements present in the HTML5</h2>
